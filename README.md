# User Story
As a web developer, our objective is to establish web pages that is widely accessible and optimised to accompany user requirements. In doing so, we should adopt an upstanding practice to ensure we consider the target audience needs, including high contrast colours, big fonts and legible font for low vision users, ensure links and other webpage functions are operational and our code is semantic and logical. As a client, I want to adhere to all these accessibilty standards to ensure that our page is optimised for an overall positive experience for all users. 

# Acceptance criteria
The webpage, accessible at https://cn-kp.github.io/homework-wk1-Accessibility/ now has:
1) Semantic html elements such as header, main, footer, h1-h6 and sections rather than div when I view source code
2) When I view Source code, appropriate selectors are used and are referenced to correctly
3) When I view image elements, all images have accessible alt tags 
4) When I view the CSS file, all styling follows a sequential structure similar to the html 
5) When I use webpage functions such as quick links, they are correctly functional 
6) When I view the webpage, background constrast is acceptable for low vision users
7) When I view the CSS code, changes are commented in detail
8) When I view navigation bar, quick links are underline to indicate that they are clickable
9) When I am finished with the above, the page is accessible and deployed to github and has a public link for usage.
